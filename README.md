### Hi!
- I am currently working on my super secret personal projects.
- I also sporadically write about engineering, software, and the future of technology, from algorithms to autonomy.
- Make sure to visit my personal site https://cogitovirus.com and add yourself to the mailing list (your inbox can handle one more email per year)!

Thanks for dropping by!
